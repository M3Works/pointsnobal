# PointSnobal
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.22216123.svg)](https://zenodo.org/records/22216123)

Python wrapped implementation of the Snobal model applied at a point.

The code in `pointsnobal/c_snobal` is the same underlying algorithms described
in [A spatially distributed energy balance snowmelt model for application in mountain basins (Marks 1999)]( https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1099-1085(199909)13:12/13<1935::AID-HYP868>3.0.CO;2-C),
which details Snobal. This code was originally available in IPW.

This software takes in a csv of **HOURLY** input data and writes a csv of daily snowpack
data.

### API usage
Example of api usage in python
```python
from pathlib import Path
import requests
import pandas as pd

api_key = "<your key>"
api_id = "bktiz24e19"
file_path = Path("<path to your input csv file>")
elevation = 1000  # your point elevation in meters (REQUIRED)
url = f"https://{api_id}.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/m3works/snobal"
# Query parameters. Only `elevation` is required; the others are optional and
# shown here at their defaults. z_u / z_t / z_g are measurement heights in
# meters, relative to the snow surface.
params = {
    "elevation": elevation,       # REQUIRED - point elevation (m)
    "z_u": 5.0,                   # wind speed measurement height (m)
    "z_t": 2.0,                   # air temperature measurement height (m)
    "z_g": 0.3,                   # soil temperature depth (m)
    "output_frequency": "daily",  # "daily" (one row per day) or "hourly"
}

output_file_name = file_path.name.replace('inputs', 'snobal')
output_file = file_path.parent.joinpath(output_file_name)

# Headers
headers = {
    "x-api-key": api_key,
    "Content-Type": "text/csv"
}

print("Reading file and calling API")
# Load the CSV file as binary data
with open(str(file_path), "rb") as file:
    response = requests.post(
        url, headers=headers, params=params, data=file)

print("API request finished")
# error if we failed
response.raise_for_status()

result = response.json()

print("Parsing results")
# Get result into pandas
df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(result['results']["data"])
```

## Running locally
### Script usage
Use `scripts/use_api.py` to call the api from the command line

```shell
python3 scripts/use_api.py <path to your file>  \
<your point elevation> --api_key <your api key>
```

This will output a csv file of the results.
Run `python3 scripts/use_api.py --help` for a full list of options.

## Input files

### Variables that inform **Snobal**
These variables are directly used within Snobal
 * `air_temp` - modeled air temp at 2m above ground
 * `percent_snow` - % mix of snow vs rain (1 == all snow) [decimal percent]
 * `precip` - precipitation mass [mm]
 * `precip_temp` - wet bulb temperature
 * `snow_density` - density of the NEW snow that hour [kg/m^3]
 * `vapor_pressure` - modeled vapor pressure
 * `wind_speed` - Wind speed at 5m above ground [m/s]
 * `soil_temp` - Average temperature of the soil column down to 30cm
 * `net_solar` - Net solar into the snowpack [w/m^2]
 * `thermal` - Incoming longwave radiation into the snowpack [w/m^2]

See `./tests/data/inputs_csl_2023.csv` for an example of data format

### Measurement heights
Heights are relative to the snow surface and default to the values below.
Override them per run with the `z_u` / `z_t` / `z_g` parameters — as API query
parameters (above), or on the CLI with `make_snow --z_u/--z_t/--z_g`.

 * `z_u` — wind speed measurement height (default 5 m)
 * `z_t` — air temperature measurement height (default 2 m)
 * `z_g` — soil temperature depth (default 0.3 m)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Watch out for...
> * Snobal expects temperatures to be in Kelvin. This code expects Celsius.
>   We do the conversion in `get_timestep_force`
> * Precip mass (`precip`) is a big driver here. Without accurate conditions,
>   model results will be poor


## Local Install
> [!TIP]
> Creating a local virtual environment with your tool of choice is recommended to isolate your code
> prior to installation.

### Download Code
Navigate to a directory where you would like to download the repo, for example a `projects` directory in your home, and
clone the repository.

```shell
cd ~/projects
git clone git@github.com:M3Works/pointsnobal.git
cd pointsnobal
```

### Requirements


Requirements can be found in `requirements.txt`.

> [!NOTE]
> A C-compiler with OpenMP support is required, on linux this is generally available. On macOS using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a simple option.
> ```shell
> brew install gcc libomp
> ```

For local build:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace
python3 install .
```

### PointSnobal script
The entrypoint is `make_snow` once installed:

```shell
make_snow <path to input file> <elevation in meters>
```

For example, the installation can be quickly verified by running the test problem.

```shell
make_snow ./tests/data/inputs_csl_2023.csv 2101 --output_file test.csv
```


## Validation data
Using [metloom](https://github.com/M3Works/metloom) for station data that
can be used for validation. `get_daily_data` returns a GeoPandas DataFrame
of the variables and units on a daily timestep. Validation is crucial in
snowpack modeling!

```python
# Imports
import pandas as pd
from metloom.pointdata import CDECPointData
from metloom.variables import CdecStationVariables

# Specify start and end date
start_date = pd.to_datetime("2019-10-01")
end_date = pd.to_datetime("2020-06-01")

# List of variables to request
desired_variables = [
    CdecStationVariables.SWE, CdecStationVariables.SNOWDEPTH
]

# Define the point
point = CDECPointData("GRV", "Graveyard Meadow")

# Request the data
df = point.get_daily_data(
    start_date, end_date, desired_variables
)
# Data comes back indexed on `datetime` and `site`, reset to just datetime
df = df.reset_index().set_index("datetime")
# Show the results
print(df)
# store in csv if you want
df.to_csv(f"{point.id}_station_data.csv", index_label="datetime")

```

## Troubleshoting

### Install issues on macOS
If you are getting `'omp.h' file not found` or `ld: library not found for -lomp` during the
`setup.py build_ext` step you need to be sure that the correct compiler is being utilized and the OpenMP libraries are available.

First, set the `CC` environment variable to your C-compiler. For example, the following
is are the paths used on macOS when using homebrew.

```shell
export CC=/usr/local/bin/gcc-14 # Intel
export CC=/opt/homebrew/bin/gcc-14 # Apple silicon
```

Second, be sure the OpenMP libraries are available to the compiler. This can
be accomplished by setting the `LDFLAGS` envornment variable. For example, for
`libomp` install with homebrew.

```shell
export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/libomp/lib" # Intel
export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/hombrew/Cellar/libomp/lib" # Apple silicon
```

For additional help on these path, when using homebrew, utilize the `brew info gcc` and `brew info libomp`commands.
